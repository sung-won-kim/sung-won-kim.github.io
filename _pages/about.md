I'm a master student in <a href='https://kse.kaist.ac.kr'>Graduate School of Data Science</a> at <a href='https://kaist.ac.kr'>KAIST</a>, where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href='http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/'>Prof. Chanyoung Park</a>.

I'm actively on research with my best colleagues at <a href='http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr'>Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab</a>.

I am primarily focused on data mining and machine learning, with a particular interest in graph data analysis. My research is driven by exploring practical applications, such as few-shot learning, meta-learning, and other related areas.
