I'm a Ph.D. student in <a href='https://gsds.kaist.ac.kr'>Graduate School of Data Science</a> at <a href='https://kaist.ac.kr'>KAIST</a>, where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href='http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/'>Prof. Chanyoung Park</a>.

I'm actively on research with my best colleagues at <a href='http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr'>Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab</a>.

I am primarily focused on data mining and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on solving problems using graph neural networks. My research is largely data-driven, aiming to solve challenging problems in real-world scenarios.

- Graph Neural Networks  
  - Learning-based 3D Simulation
    - How can we efficiently interact with opposing surfaces while maintaining computational efficiency?
  - Federated Learning  
    - What distributed knowledge truly helps improve other clients?
    - How can we generate synthetic data without compromising privacy?
    - How can we personalize local models without forgetting global knowledge?
  - Data-Efficient Deep Learning  
    - How can we generalize underlying semantics with extremely limited training data?

I actively seek practical challenges from the real world, regardless of domain. Recently, Iâ€™ve been especially focused on 3D analysis and scientific problems.
