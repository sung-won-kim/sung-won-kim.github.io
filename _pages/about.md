I'm a Ph.D. candidate in <a href='https://gsds.kaist.ac.kr'>Graduate School of Data Science</a> at <a href='https://kaist.ac.kr'>KAIST</a>, where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href='http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/'>Prof. Chanyoung Park</a>.

I'm actively on research with my best colleagues at <a href='http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr'>Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab</a>.

<!-- My research is largely data-driven, aiming to solve challenging problems in real-world scenarios. -->

🔬 Core Research Focus

**AI Surrogate Modeling for CAE (Computer-Aided Engineering)**  

My primary research is dedicated to developing **high-fidelity AI surrogate models** to replace computationally intensive 3D CAE simulations (e.g., structural mechanics, fluid dynamics, injection molding analysis, etc.). This work directly accelerates engineering design cycles and lowers computational costs.  

  `Keywords: Physics AI (Engineering), 3D Simulation, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Data-Efficient Learning`  

**Key Focus:**
  - Designing **effective 3D representations** (point-cloud, mesh, etc.) to achieve **maximal speed and accuracy** in surrogate models.
  - Integrating LLMs to significantly enhance model **usability** and streamline complex engineering workflows for practical application.

**Projects:**  
Physics-AI, Learning-based 3D Simulation **(Collaboration with LG Electronics)**  
  - How can we create a learning-based alternative to the FEM for 3D inputs with highly complex geometries, given the initial and boundary conditions? (Point-cloud based)
  - How can we efficiently interact with opposing surfaces while maintaining computational efficiency? (Mesh based)
