I'm a Ph.D. student in <a href='https://gsds.kaist.ac.kr'>Graduate School of Data Science</a> at <a href='https://kaist.ac.kr'>KAIST</a>, where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href='http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/'>Prof. Chanyoung Park</a>.

I'm actively on research with my best colleagues at <a href='http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr'>Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab</a>.

I am primarily focused on data mining and machine learning, with a particular interest in graph data analysis. 
<!-- My research is driven by exploring data-efficient methods that not only leverage the powerful performance of deep learning but also maintain applicability to training and inference time when applied to real-world scenarios.   -->
